# learning-r-survey README
This repo contains both the survey instruments, analysis documents, and data from the learning R survey.

The data for this survey comes from a Google Sheet, which is at

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19N-b-f7ogcLoM6I_jqZT9U9Qxl7UslftFwK87vokAxA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19N-b-f7ogcLoM6I_jqZT9U9Qxl7UslftFwK87vokAxA/edit?usp=sharing)

or for the Spanish language version:

The primary document for processing the survey is `process_survey_multilanguage.Rmd`. I'll be updating this continuously as I explore the data and work on creating exploratory graphics. I expect that I'll then write a shorter version of script to generate the final slides for the talk and to include insights and conclusions.

The `process_survey_multilanguage.Rmd` document has some parameters you will want to set. One of those is the `language parameter`, which selects whether you are processing the English or Spanish language version of the survey.

Feel free to add your own scripts and ideas to the repo!
