# learning-r-survey README
This repo contains both the survey instruments, analysis documents, and data from the learning R survey.

The data for this survey comes from a Google Sheet, which is at

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19N-b-f7ogcLoM6I_jqZT9U9Qxl7UslftFwK87vokAxA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19N-b-f7ogcLoM6I_jqZT9U9Qxl7UslftFwK87vokAxA/edit?usp=sharing)

The primary document for processing the survey is `process_survey.Rmd`. I'll be updating this continuously as I explore the data and work on creating exploratory graphics. I expect that I'll then write a shorter version of script to generate the final slides for the talk and to include insights and conclusions.

Feel free to add your own scripts and ideas to the repo!
